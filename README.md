# Iconic
Highly configurable icon picker for Umbraco.

## Introduction
With Iconic you will be able to create a property editor that can use virtually any font package out there and not only that, you will  be able to select your icon from more than one package on the same property.

## Installation

Use V5 for Umbraco 10.2.0 and above\
Use V3 for Umbraco 8, 9 & 10.1.0\
Use V2 for Umbraco 8\
Use V1 for Umbraco 7

### Upgrading to Iconic V5
The new version 5 of Iconic is built as a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/ui-class?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio" target="_blank">Razor Class Library</a> (RCL). The dll generated contains all the files that otherwise would go into your `App_Plugins` folder.
If you are upgrading from previous Iconic versions, you will need to remove the Iconic files contained in the `App_Plugins` folder.
