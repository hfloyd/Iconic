# Iconic Configuration: Material Icons

*[If you have successfully configured Glyphicons, please consider contributing to this doc!]*

## Icons source file

Other packages like Material Icons use the glyph codes or even ligatures to display the icon instead a specific css selector. 
```
<i class="material-icons">alarm</i> (Template: <i class="material-icons">{icon}</i>)
```
So this file can be the same css file or another files use to extract the icons property. In the case of Material Icons for instance there is a file called <a href="https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/blob/master/iconfont/codepoints">codepoints</a> where you can extract the icons names from.
